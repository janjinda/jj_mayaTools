<h1>JJ OBJ Toolkit</h1>

<b>Download</b> - <br>

<b>Latest version </b> - v0.9.9 <br>

<b>Maya version</b> - tested in 2018, 2017, 2016 <br>
<p>
    This toolkit is a set of simple scripts tailored to provide clean, easier and more affective workflow for handling OBJ files in Maya. Thanks to the Import as blend shape options it keeps all your scene hierarchy, geometry UVs, shader assignments etc.
</p>

<h3>Why OBJ?</h3>
<p>OBJ is basically very simple text file containing just vertex positions, face normals, UVs and group names. Therefore it is very suitable if model is needed to be passed between softwares. Probably the main destination for OBJ files is ZBrush. It is used not just for sculpting details, but even for bigger overall changes to a lot of individual geometries, thanks to it's Transpose Master.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
    Copy <i>jj_objToolkit.py</i> from the zip file to your scripts folder. Usually at these locations ():
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Windows</b> - <i>\&ltuserâ€™s directory&gt\My Documents/Maya\&ltversion&gt\scripts</i></li>
    <li><b>MacOs</b> - <i>/Users/Shared/Autodesk/Maya/&ltversion&gt/scripts</i></li>
    <li><b>Linux</b> - <i>$MAYA_APP_DIR/Maya/&ltversion&gt/scripts</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Run following script or make a shelf button with following script (<a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya/files/GUID-527023AE-9FB5-4D01-8D29-075B1E6C4754-htm.html">How to make a shelf button</a>)</p>

import jj_objToolkit<br>
ui = jj_objToolkit.showUI()<br>

<h4>Import</h4>
<p>Choose one or multiple OBJ files. All those will be imported and grouped in OBJ_import_grp (unless Import as single geo is enabled). Script will name every geometry based on the file name free from all the clutter Maya usually imports with OBJs (shaders, shading groups, faceted normals,  selection sets, etc.)</p>

<h4>Import Single as bShape</h4>
<p>Select one geometry and choose an OBJ file which will be applied as a blend shape. Controller will be automatically created with a blend value attribute. If OBJ is not a valid geometry for a blend shape, it will be grouped to OBJ_import_grp.</p>

<h4>Import Batch as bShape</h4>
<p>Choose an OBJ files which will be applied as blend shapes to corresponding geometries in the scene based on matching OBJ and geometry name. Controller will be automatically created with a blend value attribute. If OBJ is not a valid geometry for a blend shape, it will be grouped to OBJ_import_grp.</p>

<h4>Import Options</h4>
<p><b><i>Import as single geo</i></b> - When enabled multiple OBJ files will be combined to a single geometry</p>
<p><b><i>Delete history</i></b> - When enabled a blend shape controller would not be created and construction history will be deleted on blend shaped geometries</p>

<h4>Export</h4>
<p>Select one or multiple geometries or parent of the hierarchy. All selected geometries or geometries found in hierarchy will be exported as individual OBJs (unless Export as single OBJ is enabled) and they will be named after geometry names.</p>

<h4>Export Options</h4>
<p><b><i>Export as single OBJe</i></b> - When enabled selected geometries or hierarchy will be exported as single OBJ file.</p>
<p><b><i>Force Overwrite</i></b> - skips Maya's dialog when overwriting existing OBJ file</p>
